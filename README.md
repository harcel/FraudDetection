# FraudDetection
A small working demo of a possible fraud detection algorithm, that is designed to catch fraud by service providers such as healthcare providers. All data is fictional.

***
Work in progress...! In due time, this will get ever more complete. For now there is:
- A library of fraud detection models (these are not yet called from anywhere).
- A notebook describing the (creation of) a mock data set used for fraud detection: Mock_data.ipynb
- A data directory with three versions of the mock data set, generated by Mock_data.ipynb: data/mock_healthcare.*
