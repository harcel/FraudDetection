# FraudDetection
A small working demo of a possible fraud detection algorithm, that is designed to catch fraud by service providers such as healthcare providers. All data is fictional. 

***
- A library of fraud detection models (these are not yet called from anywhere).
- A notebook describing the (creation of) a mock data set used for fraud detection: Mock_data.ipynb
- A data directory with three versions of the mock data set, generated by Mock_data.ipynb: data/mock_healthcare.*
- models_explanation.pdf that has a description of all ten fraud detection models, their options and how their results are combined into one overall fraud risk score.
- Showcases.ipynb has two of the models worked out in some detail, with visuals, to give an idea of what respective fraud detection models can do. These are only two of ten models used in total.
- HybridFraudDetection.ipynb is a notebook that shows how to combine all models into a total fraud risk score. For now this works, but still gives some warnings that need attention, and outbput that needs layout.
